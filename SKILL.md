# MongoDB Atlas Streams

Build, operate, and debug Atlas Stream Processing (ASP) pipelines using four MCP tools from the MongoDB MCP Server.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the **MongoDB MCP Server** connected with:
- Atlas API credentials (`apiClientId` and `apiClientSecret`)
- `previewFeatures: ["streams"]` enabled in the MCP server config

The 4 tools: `atlas-streams-discover`, `atlas-streams-build`, `atlas-streams-manage`, `atlas-streams-teardown`.

## If MCP tools are unavailable

If the MongoDB MCP Server is not connected or the streams tools are missing:
1. Verify MCP server config has `previewFeatures: ["streams"]` enabled
2. For read-only exploration: use `atlas streams` CLI commands (requires Atlas CLI installed)
3. For pipeline prototyping: use `sp.process()` in mongosh (runs pipelines ephemerally, no billing)
4. Full CRUD operations require the MCP server — help the user fix their setup

## Tool Selection Matrix

**Every tool call requires `projectId`.** If unknown, call `atlas-list-projects` first.

### atlas-streams-discover — ALL read operations
| Action | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `list-workspaces` | See all workspaces in a project |
| `inspect-workspace` | Review workspace config, state, region |
| `list-connections` | See all connections in a workspace |
| `inspect-connection` | Check connection state, config, health |
| `list-processors` | See all processors in a workspace |
| `inspect-processor` | Check processor state, pipeline, config |
| `diagnose-processor` | Full health report: state, stats, errors |
| `get-logs` | Operational logs (runtime errors) or audit logs (lifecycle) |
| `get-networking` | PrivateLink and VPC peering details |

**Pagination** (all list actions): `limit` (1-100, default 20), `pageNum` (default 1).
**Response format**: `responseFormat` — `"concise"` (default for list actions) or `"detailed"` (default for inspect/diagnose).

### atlas-streams-build — ALL create operations
| Resource | Key parameters |
|----------|---------------|
| `workspace` | `cloudProvider`, `region`, `tier` (default SP10), `includeSampleData` |
| `connection` | `connectionName`, `connectionType` (Kafka/Cluster/S3/Https/Kinesis/Lambda/SchemaRegistry/Sample), `connectionConfig` |
| `processor` | `processorName`, `pipeline` (must start with `$source`, end with `$merge`/`$emit`), `dlq`, `autoStart` |
| `privatelink` | `privateLinkProvider`, `privateLinkConfig` |

**Field mapping — only fill fields for the selected resource type:**

- **resource = "workspace":** Fill: `projectId`, `workspaceName`, `cloudProvider`, `region`, `tier`, `includeSampleData`. Leave empty: all connection and processor fields.
- **resource = "connection":** Fill: `projectId`, `workspaceName`, `connectionName`, `connectionType`, `connectionConfig`. Leave empty: all workspace and processor fields. (See [references/connection-configs.md](references/connection-configs.md) for type-specific schemas.)
- **resource = "processor":** Fill: `projectId`, `workspaceName`, `processorName`, `pipeline`, `dlq` (recommended), `autoStart` (optional). Leave empty: all workspace and connection fields. (See [references/pipeline-patterns.md](references/pipeline-patterns.md) for pipeline examples.)
- **resource = "privatelink":** Fill: `projectId`, `workspaceName`, `privateLinkProvider`, `privateLinkConfig`. Leave empty: all connection and processor fields.

### atlas-streams-manage — ALL update/state operations
| Action | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `start-processor` | Begins billing. Optional `tier` override, `resumeFromCheckpoint` |
| `stop-processor` | Stops billing. Retains state 45 days |
| `modify-processor` | Processor must be stopped first. Change pipeline, DLQ, or name |
| `update-workspace` | Change tier or region |
| `update-connection` | Update config (networking is immutable — must delete and recreate) |
| `accept-peering` / `reject-peering` | VPC peering management |

**Field mapping** — always fill `projectId`, `workspaceName`, then by action:

- `"start-processor"` → `resourceName`. Optional: `tier`, `resumeFromCheckpoint`, `startAtOperationTime`
- `"stop-processor"` → `resourceName`
- `"modify-processor"` → `resourceName`. At least one of: `pipeline`, `dlq`, `newName`
- `"update-workspace"` → `newRegion` or `newTier`
- `"update-connection"` → `resourceName`, `connectionConfig`. **Exception: networking config (e.g., PrivateLink) cannot be modified after creation** — delete and recreate.
- `"accept-peering"` → `peeringId`, `requesterAccountId`, `requesterVpcId`
- `"reject-peering"` → `peeringId`

**State pre-checks:**
- `start-processor` → errors if processor is already STARTED
- `stop-processor` → no-ops if already STOPPED or CREATED (not an error)
- `modify-processor` → errors if processor is STARTED (must stop first)

### atlas-streams-teardown — ALL delete operations
| Resource | Safety behavior |
|----------|----------------|
| `processor` | Auto-stops before deleting |
| `connection` | Blocks if referenced by running processor |
| `workspace` | Cascading delete of all connections and processors |
| `privatelink` / `peering` | Remove networking resources |

**Field mapping** — always fill `projectId`, `resource`, then:

- `resource: "workspace"` → `workspaceName`
- `resource: "connection"` or `"processor"` → `workspaceName`, `resourceName`
- `resource: "privatelink"` or `"peering"` → `resourceName` (the ID)

## CRITICAL: Validate Before Creating Processors

**You MUST call `search-knowledge` before composing any processor pipeline.** This is not optional.
- **Field validation:** Query with the sink/source type, e.g. "Atlas Stream Processing $emit S3 fields" or "Atlas Stream Processing Kafka $source configuration". This catches errors like `prefix` vs `path` for S3 `$emit`.
- **Pattern examples:** Query with `dataSources: [{"name": "devcenter"}]` for working pipelines, e.g. "Atlas Stream Processing tumbling window example".

Also fetch examples from the official ASP examples repo when building non-trivial processors: **https://github.com/mongodb/ASP_example** (quickstarts, example processors, Terraform examples). Start with `example_processors/README.md` for the full pattern catalog.

Key quickstarts:
| Quickstart | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| `00_hello_world.json` | Inline `$source.documents` with `$match` (zero infra, ephemeral) |
| `01_changestream_basic.json` | Change stream → tumbling window → `$merge` to Atlas |
| `03_kafka_to_mongo.json` | Kafka source → tumbling window rollup → `$merge` to Atlas |
| `04_mongo_to_mongo.json` | Chained processors: rollup → archive to separate collection |
| `05_kafka_tail.json` | Real-time Kafka topic monitoring (sinkless, like `tail -f`) |

## Pipeline Rules & Warnings

**Invalid constructs** — these are NOT valid in streaming pipelines:
- **`$$NOW`**, **`$$ROOT`**, **`$$CURRENT`** — NOT available in stream processing. NEVER use these. Use the document's own timestamp field or `_stream_meta` metadata for event time instead of `$$NOW`.
- **HTTPS connections as `$source`** — HTTPS is for `$https` enrichment only
- **Kafka `$source` without `topic`** — topic field is required
- **Pipelines without a sink** — `$merge`/`$emit` required for deployed processors (sinkless only works via `sp.process()`)
- **Lambda as `$emit` target** — Lambda uses `$externalFunction` (mid-pipeline enrichment), not `$emit`
- **`$validate` with `validationAction: "error"`** — crashes processor; use `"dlq"` instead

**Required fields by stage:**
- **`$source` (change stream)**: include `fullDocument: "updateLookup"` to get the full document content
- **`$source` (Kinesis)**: use `stream` (NOT `streamName` or `topic`) for the Kinesis stream name. Example: `{"$source": {"connectionName": "my-kinesis", "stream": "my-stream"}}`
- **`$emit` (Kinesis)**: MUST include `partitionKey`. Example: `{"$emit": {"connectionName": "my-kinesis", "stream": "my-stream", "partitionKey": "$fieldName"}}`
- **`$emit` (S3)**: use `path` (NOT `prefix`). Example: `{"$emit": {"connectionName": "my-s3", "bucket": "my-bucket", "path": "data/year={$year}", "config": {"outputFormat": {"name": "json"}}}}`
- **`$https`**: must include `connectionName`, `path`, `method` (GET/POST), `as`, and `onError: "dlq"`
- **`$externalFunction`**: must include `connectionName`, `functionName`, `execution` ("sync"/"async"), `as`, `onError: "dlq"`
- **`$validate`**: must include `validator` with `$jsonSchema` and `validationAction: "dlq"`
- **`$lookup`**: include `parallelism` setting (e.g., `parallelism: 2`) for concurrent I/O
- **AWS connections** (S3, Kinesis, Lambda): IAM role ARN must be **registered in the Atlas project via Cloud Provider Access** before creating the connection. This is a prerequisite — the connection creation will fail without it. **Always mention this prerequisite** in your response, even if the user says connections already exist. Confirm: "IAM role ARNs are registered via Atlas Cloud Provider Access" or "Ensure IAM role ARNs are registered via Atlas Cloud Provider Access before creating connections."

**SchemaRegistry connection:** `connectionType` must be `"SchemaRegistry"` (not `"Kafka"`). See [references/connection-configs.md](references/connection-configs.md#schemaregistry) for required fields and auth types.

## MCP Tool Behaviors

**Elicitation:** When creating connections, the build tool auto-collects missing sensitive fields (passwords, bootstrap servers) via MCP elicitation. Do NOT ask the user for these — let the tool collect them.

**Auto-normalization:**
- `bootstrapServers` array → auto-converted to comma-separated string
- `schemaRegistryUrls` string → auto-wrapped in array
- `dbRoleToExecute` → defaults to `{role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", type: "BUILT_IN"}` for Cluster connections

**Region naming:** The `region` field uses Atlas-specific names that differ by cloud provider. Using the wrong format returns a cryptic `dataProcessRegion` error.

| Provider | Cloud Region | Atlas `region` Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **AWS** | us-east-1 | `VIRGINIA_USA` |
| **AWS** | us-east-2 | `US_EAST_2` |
| **AWS** | us-west-2 | `OREGON_USA` |
| **AWS** | ca-central-1 | `CA_CENTRAL_1` |
| **AWS** | sa-east-1 | `SA_EAST_1` |
| **AWS** | eu-west-1 | `IRELAND_IRL` |
| **GCP** | us-central1 | `US_CENTRAL1` |
| **GCP** | europe-west1 | `WESTERN_EUROPE` |
| **Azure** | eastus | `US_EAST_1` |
| **Azure** | eastus2 | `US_EAST_2` |
| **Azure** | westus | `US_WEST` |
| **Azure** | westeurope | `EUROPE_WEST` |
| **AWS** | ap-southeast-1 | `AP_SOUTHEAST_1` |
| **AWS** | ap-south-1 | `AP_SOUTH_1` |
| **AWS** | ap-northeast-1 | `AP_NORTHEAST_1` |

This is a partial list. If unsure, inspect an existing workspace with `atlas-streams-discover` → `inspect-workspace` and check `dataProcessRegion.region`.

## Connection Capabilities — Source/Sink Reference

Know what each connection type can do before creating pipelines:

| Connection Type | As Source ($source) | As Sink ($merge / $emit) | Mid-Pipeline | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Cluster** | ✅ Change streams | ✅ $merge to collections | ✅ $lookup | Change streams monitor insert/update/delete/replace operations |
| **Kafka** | ✅ Topic consumer | ✅ $emit to topics | ❌ | Source MUST include `topic` field |
| **Sample Stream** | ✅ Sample data | ❌ Not valid | ❌ | Testing/demo only |
| **S3** | ❌ Not valid | ✅ $emit to buckets | ❌ | Sink only - use `path`, `format`, `compression` |
| **Https** | ❌ Not valid | ✅ $https as sink | ✅ $https enrichment | Can be used mid-pipeline for enrichment OR as final sink stage |
| **AWSLambda** | ❌ Not valid | ✅ $externalFunction (async only) | ✅ $externalFunction (sync or async) | **Sink:** `execution: "async"` required. **Mid-pipeline:** `execution: "sync"` or `"async"` |
| **AWS Kinesis** | ✅ Stream consumer | ✅ $emit to streams | ❌ | Similar to Kafka pattern |
| **SchemaRegistry** | ❌ Not valid | ❌ Not valid | ✅ Schema resolution | **Metadata only** - used by Kafka connections for Avro schemas |

**Common connection usage mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Using HTTPS connections as `$source` → HTTPS is for enrichment or sink only
- ❌ Using `$externalFunction` as sink with `execution: "sync"` → Must use `execution: "async"` for sink stage
- ❌ Forgetting change streams exist → Atlas Cluster is a powerful source, not just a sink
- ❌ Using `$merge` with Kafka → Use `$emit` for Kafka sinks

**$externalFunction execution modes:**
- **Mid-pipeline:** Can use `execution: "sync"` (blocks until Lambda returns) or `execution: "async"` (non-blocking)
- **Final sink stage:** MUST use `execution: "async"` only

## Tier Reference

| Tier | vCPU | RAM | Max Parallelism | Use case |
|------|------|-----|-----------------|----------|
| SP2 | 0.25 | 512MB | 1 | Minimal filtering, testing |
| SP5 | 0.5 | 1GB | 2 | Simple filtering and routing |
| SP10 | 1 | 2GB | 8 | Moderate workloads, joins, grouping |
| SP30 | 2 | 8GB | 16 | Windows, JavaScript UDFs (`$function`), production |
| SP50 | 8 | 32GB | 64 | High throughput, large window state |

**`$function` (JavaScript UDFs) requires SP30+.** Memory rule: user state must stay below 80% of tier RAM.

For automated tier selection, use the **complexity scoring heuristic** in [`references/sizing-and-parallelism.md`](references/sizing-and-parallelism.md#complexity-scoring-heuristic) — score pipeline features, map to a tier, and take the higher of complexity-driven vs parallelism-driven recommendations.

## Core Workflows

### Setup from scratch
1. `atlas-streams-discover` → `list-workspaces` (check existing)
2. `atlas-streams-build` → `resource: "workspace"` (region near data, SP10 for dev)
3. `atlas-streams-build` → `resource: "connection"` (for each source/sink/enrichment)
4. Call `search-knowledge` to validate field names. Fetch relevant examples from https://github.com/mongodb/ASP_example
5. `atlas-streams-build` → `resource: "processor"` (with DLQ configured)
6. `atlas-streams-manage` → `start-processor` (warn about billing)

### Modify a pipeline
1. `atlas-streams-manage` → `stop-processor`
2. `atlas-streams-manage` → `modify-processor` (new pipeline)
3. `atlas-streams-manage` → `start-processor`

- `action: "list-workspaces"` — list all workspaces in a project
- `action: "inspect-workspace"` — details on a specific workspace
- `action: "list-connections"` / `"inspect-connection"` — connections in a workspace
- `action: "list-processors"` / `"inspect-processor"` — processors in a workspace
- `action: "diagnose-processor"` — combined health report (state, stats, connection health, errors, actionable recommendations)
- `action: "get-logs"` — operational logs (default) or audit logs. Use `logType: "operational"` for runtime errors (Kafka failures, schema issues, OOM). Use `logType: "audit"` for lifecycle events (start/stop). Optionally filter by `resourceName` (processor name).
- `action: "get-networking"` — PrivateLink/VPC peering. Optionally provide `cloudProvider` and `region` for account details.

**Pagination** (all list actions): `limit` (1-100, default 20), `pageNum` (default 1).
**Response format**: `responseFormat` — `"concise"` (default for list actions: names/states only) or `"detailed"` (default for inspect/diagnose: full config).

#### atlas-streams-manage field mapping

Always fill: `projectId`, `workspaceName`. Then by action:

- `"start-processor"` → `resourceName`. Optional: `tier`, `resumeFromCheckpoint`, `startAtOperationTime`
- `"stop-processor"` → `resourceName`
- `"modify-processor"` → `resourceName`. At least one of: `pipeline`, `dlq`, `newName`
- `"update-workspace"` → `newRegion` or `newTier`
- `"update-connection"` → `resourceName`, `connectionConfig`. Works for updating credentials, bootstrap servers, and other config. **Exception: networking config (e.g., PrivateLink) cannot be modified after creation** — to change networking, delete and recreate the connection.
- `"accept-peering"` → `peeringId`, `requesterAccountId`, `requesterVpcId`
- `"reject-peering"` → `peeringId`

#### atlas-streams-teardown field mapping

Always fill: `projectId`, `resource`. Then:

- `resource: "workspace"` → `workspaceName`
- `resource: "connection"` or `"processor"` → `workspaceName`, `resourceName`
- `resource: "privatelink"` or `"peering"` → `resourceName` (the ID)

**CRITICAL — Before deleting a workspace:**
You MUST call `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "inspect-workspace"` first to get the current count of connections and processors. Then present this information to the user BEFORE asking for confirmation:
- Number of connections that will be deleted (list their names and types)
- Number of processors that will be deleted (list their names and states)
- Make it clear this action is permanent and cannot be undone

Example workflow:
1. User: "delete workspace X"
2. Call `inspect-workspace` for workspace X
3. Present: "Workspace X contains 2 connections (kafka, mongodb_atlas) and 3 processors (processor1: STOPPED, processor2: STARTED, processor3: CREATED). Deleting this workspace will permanently remove all of these resources. Proceed?"
4. Wait for user confirmation
5. Call `atlas-streams-teardown`

### Step 3: Sequence multi-step workflows

**Setup from scratch:**
1. `atlas-streams-build` → `resource: "workspace"` (cloud, region, tier)
2. `atlas-streams-build` → `resource: "connection"` (one call per connection)
3. **BEFORE creating processor - REQUIRED VALIDATION**:
   - Call `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "list-connections"` to verify all required connections exist
   - Call `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "inspect-connection"` for EACH connection referenced in your pipeline
   - Verify connection names match their actual targets (e.g., connection "atlascluster" should actually point to the intended cluster)
   - Present connection summary to user showing any name/target mismatches
   - Ask for confirmation before proceeding if mismatches exist
4. `atlas-streams-build` → `resource: "processor"` (reference connections by name in pipeline)
5. Set `autoStart: true` in step 4, or call `atlas-streams-manage` → `action: "start-processor"`

**Incremental pipeline development (recommended):**
See [references/development-workflow.md](references/development-workflow.md) for the full 5-phase lifecycle.
1. Start with basic `$source` → `$merge` pipeline (validate connectivity)
2. Add `$match` stages (validate filtering)
3. Add `$addFields` / `$project` transforms (validate reshaping)
4. Add windowing or enrichment (validate aggregation logic)
5. Add error handling / DLQ configuration

**Modify a processor pipeline:**
1. `atlas-streams-manage` → `action: "stop-processor"` — **processor MUST be stopped first**
2. `atlas-streams-manage` → `action: "modify-processor"` — provide new pipeline
3. `atlas-streams-manage` → `action: "start-processor"` — restart

**Debug a failing processor:**
See [references/output-diagnostics.md](references/output-diagnostics.md) for the full decision framework.
1. `atlas-streams-discover` → `diagnose-processor` — one-shot health report. Always call this first.
2. `atlas-streams-discover` → `get-logs` (`logType: "operational"`) — runtime errors, Kafka failures, schema issues, OOM messages. Filter by `resourceName` for a specific processor. Always call this second.
3. **Commit to a specific root cause.** After reviewing the diagnose output and logs, identify THE primary issue — do not present a list of hypothetical scenarios. Common patterns:
   - **Error 419 + "no partitions found"** → Kafka topic doesn't exist or is misspelled
   - **State: FAILED + multiple restarts** → connection-level error (bypasses DLQ), check logs for the repeated error
   - **State: STARTED + zero output + windowed pipeline** → likely idle Kafka partitions blocking window closure; check for missing `partitionIdleTimeout`
   - **State: STARTED + zero output + non-windowed** → check if source has data; inspect Kafka offset lag
   - **High memoryUsageBytes approaching tier limit** → OOM risk; recommend higher tier
   - **DLQ count increasing** → per-document processing errors; use MongoDB `find` on DLQ collection
4. Classify processor type before interpreting output volume:
   - **Alert/anomaly processors**: low or zero output is NORMAL and healthy
   - **Data transformation processors**: low output is a RED FLAG
   - **Filter processors**: variable output depending on data match rate
5. Provide concrete, ordered fix steps specific to the diagnosed root cause (e.g., "stop → modify pipeline to add partitionIdleTimeout → restart with resumeFromCheckpoint: false").
6. If lifecycle event history needed → `atlas-streams-discover` → `get-logs`, `logType: "audit"` — shows start/stop events

### Chained processors (multi-sink pattern)
**CRITICAL: A single pipeline can only have ONE terminal sink** (`$merge` or `$emit`). You CANNOT have both `$merge` and `$emit` as terminal stages. When a user requests multiple output destinations (e.g., "write to Atlas AND emit to Kafka" or "archive to S3 AND send to Lambda"), you MUST:
1. **Acknowledge** the single-sink constraint explicitly in your response
2. **Propose chained processors**: Processor A reads source → enriches → writes to intermediate via `$merge` (Atlas) or `$emit` (Kafka). Processor B reads from that intermediate (change stream or Kafka topic) → emits to second destination. Kafka-as-intermediate is lower latency; Atlas-as-intermediate is simpler to inspect.
3. **Show both processor pipelines** including any `$lookup` enrichment stages with `parallelism` settings.

**Tear down:**
**BEFORE deleting a workspace**, inspect it first with `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "inspect-workspace"` to determine how many connections and processors will be deleted. Present this information to the user and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

You can delete workspace directly (removes all contained resources), or delete individually: delete processors (auto-stops if running) → delete connections (fails if referenced by running processors) → delete workspace.

Note: `$externalFunction` (Lambda) is a mid-pipeline stage, NOT a terminal sink. A pipeline can use `$externalFunction` AND still have a terminal `$merge`/`$emit` — this is a valid single-sink pattern, but explain WHY it works (Lambda is invoked mid-pipeline, not as a sink).

### Verify after deploy
1. `atlas-streams-discover` → `inspect-processor` (state = STARTED)
2. `atlas-streams-discover` → `diagnose-processor` (health report)
3. MongoDB `count` on DLQ collection (should be 0)
4. MongoDB `find` on output collection (documents arriving with correct shape)
5. If output count is 0: check DLQ collection — if DLQ also empty, verify source has data; if DLQ has documents, inspect them for root cause

## Pre-Deploy Checklist

**Connection creation — elicitation:** When creating a connection, the build tool auto-collects missing sensitive fields (passwords, bootstrap servers, usernames) via an interactive form using the MCP elicitation protocol. Do NOT ask the user for these fields yourself — let the tool elicit them.

**Connection creation — auto-normalization:**
- `bootstrapServers` array → auto-converted to comma-separated string
- `schemaRegistryUrls` string → auto-wrapped in array
- `dbRoleToExecute` → auto-defaults to `{role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", type: "BUILT_IN"}` for Cluster connections

**Workspace creation — sample data:** `includeSampleData` defaults to `true`, which auto-creates the `sample_stream_solar` connection via a special API endpoint.

**State pre-checks (manage tool):**
- `start-processor` → errors if processor is already STARTED
- `stop-processor` → no-ops if already STOPPED or CREATED (not an error)
- `modify-processor` → errors if processor is STARTED (must stop first)

**Teardown safety checks:**
- **Processor deletion** → auto-stops the processor before deleting (no need to stop manually first)
- **Connection deletion** → scans all processor pipelines for references; **blocks deletion** if any running processor uses the connection. Stop/delete referencing processors first.
- **Workspace deletion** → YOU must inspect the workspace first with `atlas-streams-discover` to count connections and processors, then present this to the user before calling the teardown tool. The teardown tool will then delete the workspace and all contained resources permanently.

## Pre-Deploy Quality Checklist

Before creating a processor, verify:

### Connection Validation (MANDATORY - Always do this first)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Call `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "list-connections"` to list all connections in workspace
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Call `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "inspect-connection"` for EACH connection referenced in pipeline
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify connection names clearly indicate their actual targets (avoid generic names like "atlascluster" pointing to "ClusterRestoreTest")
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Present connection summary to user: "Connection 'X' → Actual target 'Y'" for each connection
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Warn user if connection names don't match their targets and ask for confirmation
- [ ] All connections are in READY state
- [ ] Connection types match usage (Cluster for $source/$merge, Kafka for topics, etc.)

### Pipeline Validation
- [ ] `search-knowledge` was called to validate sink/source field names
- [ ] Pipeline starts with `$source` and ends with `$merge`, `$emit`, `$https`, or `$externalFunction` (async)
- [ ] No `$$NOW`, `$$ROOT`, or `$$CURRENT` in the pipeline
- [ ] Kafka `$source` includes a `topic` field
- [ ] Kafka `$source` with windowed pipeline includes `partitionIdleTimeout` (prevents windows from stalling on idle partitions)
- [ ] HTTPS connections are only used in `$https` enrichment or sink stages, not in `$source`
- [ ] DLQ is configured (recommended for production)
- [ ] `$https` stages use `onError: "dlq"` (not `"fail"`)
- [ ] `$externalFunction` stages use `onError: "dlq"` and `execution` is explicitly set
- [ ] API auth is stored in connection settings, not hardcoded in the pipeline

## Post-Deploy Verification Workflow

After creating and starting a processor:
1. `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "inspect-processor"` — confirm state is STARTED
2. `atlas-streams-discover` → `action: "diagnose-processor"` — check for errors in the health report
3. Use MongoDB `count` tool on the DLQ collection — verify no errors accumulating
4. Use MongoDB `find` tool on the output collection — verify documents are arriving
5. If output is low/zero, classify processor type before assuming a problem (see Debug section)

## Tier Sizing & Performance

See [references/sizing-and-parallelism.md](references/sizing-and-parallelism.md) for the complete guide including complexity scoring, worked examples, and cost optimization.

### Tier Reference

| Tier | vCPU | RAM | Bandwidth | Max Parallelism | Kafka Partitions | Use case |
|------|------|-----|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| SP2  | 0.25 | 512MB | 50 Mbps | 1 | 32 | Minimal filtering, testing |
| SP5  | 0.5 | 1GB | 125 Mbps | 2 | 64 | Simple filtering and routing |
| SP10 | 1 | 2GB | 200 Mbps | 8 | Unlimited | Moderate workloads, joins, grouping |
| SP30 | 2 | 8GB | 750 Mbps | 16 | Unlimited | Windows, JavaScript UDFs, production |
| SP50 | 8 | 32GB | 2500 Mbps | 64 | Unlimited | High throughput, large window state |

### Sizing Rules
- Stream Processing reserves **20% memory for overhead** — user processes are limited to 80%
- Monitor `memoryUsageBytes` via processor stats to determine proper tier
- If memory usage exceeds 80% of tier capacity, processor fails with OOM
- Use `parallelism` setting on `$merge`, `$lookup`, `$https` for concurrent I/O operations

**Parallelism formula:** `minimum tier = sum of (parallelism - 1) for all stages where parallelism > 1`. Example: a pipeline with `$lookup` at parallelism 3 and `$merge` at parallelism 4 needs `(3-1) + (4-1) = 5` excess parallelism → requires SP10 (max 8).

### Performance Best Practices
- Place `$match` stages as early as possible to reduce downstream volume
- Place `$https` enrichment calls downstream of window stages to batch and reduce API call frequency
- Use `partitionIdleTimeout` in Kafka `$source` to unblock windows when partitions go idle
- Use descriptive processor names indicating their function (e.g., `celsius-converter`, `fraud-detector`)

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Processor FAILED on start | Invalid pipeline syntax, missing connection, `$$NOW` used | `diagnose-processor` → read error → fix pipeline |
| DLQ filling up | Schema mismatch, `$https` failures, type errors | `find` on DLQ → fix pipeline or connection |
| Zero output (transformation) | Connection issue, wrong topic, filter too strict | Check source health → verify connections → check `$match` |
| Zero output (alert) | Probably normal — no anomalies detected | Verify with known test event |
| Windows not closing | Idle Kafka partitions | Add `partitionIdleTimeout` to `$source` (e.g., `{"size": 30, "unit": "second"}`) |
| OOM / processor crash | Tier too small for window state | `diagnose-processor` → check `memoryUsageBytes` → upgrade tier |
| Slow throughput | Low parallelism on I/O stages | Increase `parallelism` on `$merge`/`$lookup`/`$https` |
| 404 on workspace | Doesn't exist or misspelled | `discover` → `list-workspaces` |
| 409 on create | Name already exists | Inspect existing resource or pick new name |
| 402 error on start | No billing configured | Do NOT retry. Add payment method in Atlas → Billing. Use `sp.process()` in mongosh as free alternative |
| "processor must be stopped" | Tried to modify running processor | `manage` → `stop-processor` first |
| bootstrapServers format | Passed as array instead of string | Use comma-separated string: `"broker1:9092,broker2:9092"` |
| "must choose at least one role" | Cluster connection without `dbRoleToExecute` | Defaults to `readWriteAnyDatabase` — or specify custom role |
| "No cluster named X" | Cluster doesn't exist in project | `atlas-list-clusters` to verify |
| IAM role ARN not found | ARN not registered in project | Register via Atlas → Cloud Provider Access |
| dataProcessRegion format | Wrong region format | See region table above. If unsure, inspect an existing workspace |
| Processor PROVISIONING for minutes | Restart cycle with exponential backoff | Wait for FAILED state, or stop → restart. Check logs for repeated error |
| Parallelism exceeded | Tier too small for requested parallelism | Start with higher tier (see `references/sizing-and-parallelism.md`) |
| Networking change needed | Networking is immutable after creation | Delete connection and recreate with new networking config |
| 401 / 403 on API call | Invalid or expired Atlas API credentials | Verify `apiClientId`/`apiClientSecret` and project-level permissions |
| 429 rate limit | Too many API calls | Wait and retry; avoid tight loops of discover calls |

## Billing & Cost

**Atlas Stream Processing has no free tier.** All deployed processors incur continuous charges while running.

- Charges are per-hour, calculated per-second, only while the processor is running
- `stop-processor` stops billing; stopped processors retain state for 45 days at no charge
- Always confirm billing setup before starting processors
- **For prototyping without billing:** Use `sp.process()` in mongosh — runs pipelines ephemerally without deploying a processor
- Stop processors when not actively needed
- See `references/sizing-and-parallelism.md` for tier pricing and cost optimization strategies

## Safety Rules

- `atlas-streams-teardown` and `atlas-streams-manage` require user confirmation — do not bypass
- **BEFORE calling `atlas-streams-teardown` for a workspace**, you MUST first inspect the workspace with `atlas-streams-discover` to count connections and processors, then present this information to the user before requesting confirmation
- **BEFORE creating any processor**, you MUST validate all connections per the "Pre-Deployment Validation" section in [references/development-workflow.md](references/development-workflow.md)
- Deleting a workspace removes ALL connections and processors permanently
- Processors must be STOPPED before modifying their pipeline
- After stopping, state is preserved 45 days — then checkpoints are discarded
- `resumeFromCheckpoint: false` drops all window state — warn user first
- Moving processors between workspaces is not supported (must recreate)
- Dry-run / simulation is not supported — explain what you would do and ask for confirmation
- Always warn users about billing before starting processors
- Store API authentication credentials in connection settings, never hardcode in processor pipelines
